<H3><font color="navy"> A Closer Look at the Ministry of Angels</font> </H3> 
<P>There has been alot of talk lately about angels on TV, but one thing folks should be asking is: 
What does the Word of God have to say about angels. Well, here is some food for thought. 
  
<P> This page is intended to get you to open your Bible and judge for yourself. If you don't know
about or try to ignore the ministry of angels, you may be missing out on a powerful service God has
provided for your deliverance. Mentioned below are several scriptures that point to a more accurate depiction
of angels than can be provided by prime-time television. It is important to remember that when reading the Bible, 
the scriptures can and have been taken out of context. To get a better understanding it is recommended that the reader
open the Bible for themselves and read surrounding scriptures, as well as link to related scriptures through a concordance.
Since your on the net, you can also do a word search for angel or angels at the <A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/">Bible Gateway</A> 


<P> But what do angels pay attention to? Can you talk to your angels? In Psalm 103:20 the scripture states that
angels excell in strengh, and that they hearken to the voice of His(The LORD's) word. It looks like Angels pay 
attention to the Word of God, and that they will not do anything for you outside of the commandment of God. This 
is where it is good to know what the Bible has to say about your situation. Don't worry, God has the best for you 
in mind. As He says in Jerimiah 29:11.

<P>
In I Kings 19:7 an angel gives Elijah cake and water so that he can continue on his journey.
When Jesus was praying on the mount of  Olives, before he was to be betrayed, an angel came from heaven and strengthened him, according to Luke 22:43

<P>
Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way .. (Ex 23:20). This scripture shows us one of God’s Holy Assignments for angels is to protect his people.<BR>
Psalm 34:7 The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.<BR>
Psalm  91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
