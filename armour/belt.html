The search for truth has gone on for centuries, but the believer should know exactly where to find truth.  The Word of God contains all the truth that man needs for this life and living. 
<P>
Jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.  He also asked God to sanctify his followers through his truth, God's Word is truth. (John 17:17)
