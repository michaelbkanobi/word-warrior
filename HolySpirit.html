<H3><font color="navy">What is the baptism of the Holy Spirit?</font> </H3> 
<P>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a long awaited promise of God. In Ezekiel 36:26-27 we are shown a piece of what God desires for his people. It says: A new heart also will I give you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh ... And I will put <U>my spirit</U> within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes ... 
<P> In these verses we can see what God wants. He does not want a people that will just follow his rules, He wants a people who walk in his ways, they follow his rules by default, as a part of their personality.
<P>The Bible shows us how God intends to fulfill his plan in the earth, through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. John the baptist, the man sent to prepare the way for the Lord, spoke of Jesus's ministry in Luke 3:16 ... I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall <u>baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire</u>

<H3><font color="navy">An enduement of power from on high.</font> </H3>
<P>The Bible tells us that Jesus was baptized with the Holy Spirit (Luke 3:22). Jesus taught folks that this baptism is where he got his annointing from. In Luke 4:18 He declares: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because he hath annointed me to preach the gospel ... Acts 10:38 says it this way: How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. 
<P>Jesus told his disciples to wait for this same power from On High to be made available to them: Luke 24:49 And behold, I will send forth upon you what My Father has promised; but remain in the city until you are clothed with power from on high. The source of this power is clarified in Acts 1:8 when Jesus says: But ye shall recieve power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be wintesses unto me...
<H3><font color="navy">The wait is over.</font> </H3>
<P>Acts 2:1-4 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.<P>Now that the Holy Spirit has been sent, He is available to every born-again person that will accept Him. The only reason most people have not accepted the baptism of the Holy Spirit is because they have not heard of it yet, Acts 19:1-7.
<H3><font color="navy">It is as simple as asking.</font> </H3>
<P>There is no complicated formula to study, no special prayer to recite 20 times. Jesus talking about God's goodness in Luke 11:11-13
tells us ... how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him (vs 13).<P>
But the Comfortor, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. (John 14:26) <P>
Sincerely ask God to be Baptized in the Holy Spirit in Jesus name and He will do it, He will give you power to witness to all the good things Jesus has done for you.<BR>
